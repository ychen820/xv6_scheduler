{"name":"Xv6 scheduler","tagline":"","body":"xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix\r\nVersion 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,\r\nbut is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nxv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer\r\nto Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,\r\n2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/v6.html, which\r\nprovides pointers to on-line resources for v6.\r\n\r\nxv6 borrows code from the following sources:\r\n    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)\r\n    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)\r\n    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)\r\n    NetBSD (console.c)\r\n\r\nThe following people have made contributions:\r\n    Russ Cox (context switching, locking)\r\n    Cliff Frey (MP)\r\n    Xiao Yu (MP)\r\n    Nickolai Zeldovich\r\n    Austin Clements\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are grateful for the bug reports and patches contributed by\r\nSilas Boyd-Wickizer, Peter Froehlich, Shivam Handa, Anders Kaseorg, Eddie\r\nKohler, Yandong Mao, Hitoshi Mitake, Carmi Merimovich, Joel Nider, Greg Price,\r\nEldar Sehayek, Yongming Shen, Stephen Tu, and Zouchangwei.\r\n\r\nThe code in the files that constitute xv6 is\r\nCopyright 2006-2014 Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, and Russ Cox.\r\n\r\nERROR REPORTS\r\n\r\nIf you spot errors or have suggestions for improvement, please send\r\nemail to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris (kaashoek,rtm@csail.mit.edu). \r\n\r\nBUILDING AND RUNNING XV6\r\n\r\nTo build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run \"make\".\r\nOn non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you will\r\nneed to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing x86 ELF\r\nbinaries.  See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/tools.html.\r\nThen run \"make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-\".\r\n\r\nTo run xv6, install the QEMU PC simulators.  To run in QEMU, run \"make qemu\".\r\n\r\nTo create a typeset version of the code, run \"make xv6.pdf\".  This\r\nrequires the \"mpage\" utility.  See http://www.mesa.nl/pub/mpage/.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
